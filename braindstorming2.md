# App Ideas Brainstorming

## App Idea 1: City Guesser

**What: What is the app for?**
Trivia game that allows the user to guess which city is given by seeing its street view in the map. Can be used for learning geography.

**Who: Who is the app for?**
This app would target geographically-conscious individuals as well as those who are interested in a geography-themed game.

**Why: Why are we building this app?**
To gain experience with XCode and swift by integrating a free API into a project, and creating a satisfying game on the user end.

**Challenges: What are some potential challenges?**
Using the Mapview in XCode to present a variety of different cities, while also restricting features such as zoom out.

## App Idea 2: Movie DB

**What: What is the app for?**
The app will connect to a MovieDB API to allow a Movie Database app to be created.

**Who: Who is the app for?** 
The app will be for movie consumers to see what movies recently came out and information on a database of movies such as review scores, actors, etc.

**Why: Why are we building this app?**
To increase our understanding of xCode and building upon what we have already learned via the movie labs and projects that we have already worked on in the past.

**Challenges: What are some potential challenges?**
Getting the API to work. Dealing with so many movie entries and making sure the display is able to fit a large amount of movie entries. 

## App Idea 3: Retail Item App

**What: What is the app for?**
This app would compare and see the prices of the same items that retail stores sell it for.

**Who: Who is the app for?**
The app is for the normal consumer to be able to see where they can get a specific item at the best price, since we are comparing prices at many places.

**Why: Why are we building this app?**
To increase our understanding of how things like the Google Shopping tab works and how to be able to turn this idea into an app.

**Challenges: What are some potential challenges?**
Getting an api to work. Being able to pull a wide range of items, and then comparing prices from many different places.
